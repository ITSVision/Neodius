Neodius is a NEO blockchain tool. Neodius let's you easily view your balance in various ways based on your address. A must have for every NEO fan. Ofcourse poured in a pretty-and-easy iOS interface. It has been submitted to the Apple AppStore. So I'm waiting for approval. Once it's approved, the link will be available here.

## What's this NEO all about
NEO, formerly Antshares, is China's first ever open source blockchain. Founded in 2014, NEOâ€™s mission has been to reinvent the way commerce is done. So basically it's just another improved Bitcoin rip-off. However, NEO has a lot of extra features which make it a good investment.

## But what does Neodius do?
Neodius was built with the idea to have a better insight into your Neo Crypto assets (love those hypie words :). Since NEO has that awesome GAS ([neotogas.com click on about](https://neotogas.com)), it's good to see how much you have and how much you can claim. But most importantly, you want to know how many beers you can buy with your NEO :beer:. So i have implemented an automatic conversion from NEO to a (realistic) fiat value.

## What are the features?
Probably the most important is:
Neodius is based on public address, no private keys needed. So no worries about your private key being abused when your iDevice is lost/abused.

Features currently are:
* Multi-wallet
* View your amount of NEO
* view your GAS
* View your unclaimed gas
* View NEO value in BTC/ETH
* View NEO value in fiat currencies ([View currencies](Neodius/Neodius/Supporting Files/SettingCache/fiatCurrencies.json))
* Automatic refreshing of your wallet. Fun for real-time stats
* Securing Neodius with a passcode or TouchID
* Quick address lookup
* Quick transaction lookup
* QRCode for your address.
* Switch between MainNet and TestNet
* Localization in
	* Dutch
	* English
	* More to come? (help us out here :kissing_heart: )
* View market information on GAS and NEO
	* Bid/ask prices
	* Current market (cap, volume, position)
	* Changes (1h, 24h, 7d)
	* Gauge showing current position on 24h tradingview
* Scanning QR-Codes to add a wallet
* GAS Calculation from a wallet or a user decided amount
* More to come! :)

## Looks awesome, but how can i use it.
### The AppStore
As stated above; it's currently being approved for the App Store where you'll soon be able to download it for free. However; since i believe in the power of open-source; it's here so everyone can use, edit and contribute to it.

**I will post the AppStore link here and on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/) when it's approved!**
